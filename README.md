#GGPLOT2 GEOM

This project illustrates how to create a new ggplot2 geom in R that allows to visualize hurricane wind fields using the data from The Tropical Cyclone Extended Best Track Dataset. The motivation of this undertaking was to solve the peer-graded assignment of the Building Data Visualization Tools course.

The purpose of this assignment is to draw on your knowledge of the grid and ggplot2 package to build a new geom. You will then need to load and tidy the provided dataset in order to plot the geom on a map.

Organization of the Files The project has the following structure:

R scripts: Includes files in 2 directories: geom_hurricane.R in R directory:It is the submitted code for the peer-graded assignment of the Coursera's course which creates two graphs of the Hurricane Ike roxygen2-style documentation in MAN directory: on how to integrate the new geom into a new R package.

GRAPHS Contains the plots created by geom_hurricane.R code in order to demonstrate how the new geom works

DATA contains clean and non clean datsets for the assignment

OTHER USEFUL RESOURCES: Includes all the resources notes that I considered relevant for this task

Review criterialess To submit this assignment you must submit

An R script containing the code implementing the geom

A plot file (in PNG or PDF format) containing a map that has the wind radii overlayed for Hurricane Ike
